## General

Components are the heart of the Impulse PHP Framework. Almost every native html tag is considered as a component itself. Unlike 'normal' (ajax based) web application such componnets have a state on client as well on server side. 

For a complete list of currently registered components you can run the following command:

<pre class="line-numbers language-bash">
<code class="language-bash">php bin/console debug:impulse:components</code>
</pre>
