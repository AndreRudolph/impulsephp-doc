### Impulse

Impulse is a modern web application framework that brings PHP applications to a complete new level, that's why I selected that name. Though its simple approach, amazing and complex AJAX applications can be created without even the need of Javascript knowledge to a certain level.

It is designed to be secure, extendable, scalable and simple to use.

### Why Symfony

The Impulse PHP Framework is completely based on Symfony fullstack framework and benefits from all of its advantages for agile and professional application development. Due to its extendable and configurable nature, Impulse is aswell extendable by configurations and even with new bundles.
