Like components, controllers will also be serialized and stored in the users session when they are registered as event listeners. The concept of serialization is to have a string representation of an object that stores its states that must be restored once the serialized object will be deserialized. 

In this documentation page we will cover the essentials of controller serialization and how you can customize the serialization with your needs.
